        description: OutlierDetector is the Schema for the OutlierDetectors API. An
          outlier detector monitors the results of a query and reports when its values
          are outside normal bands. The normal band is configured by choice of algorithm,
          its sensitivity and other configuration. Visit https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/machine-learning/outlier-detection/
